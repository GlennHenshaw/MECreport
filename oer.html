      <h3>Open Educational Resourses (OER)</h3>

      <section>
        <p class="lead">
        <strong>Open educational resources (OER)</strong> are educational materials that openly licensed and can be used for teaching, learning, research, and other purposes. OER resourses usually have creative commons licenses.
        <p class="lead">
        Developing OER was a major initiative for MEC during the 2018-2019 academic year. Below we list some of our accomplishments and statistics pertaining to our OER efforts.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>OER materials and platforms</h3>
        <p class="lead">For all of our OER sections we are using the <a href="https://lumenlearning.com/">Lumen Learning Platform</a>. Our master sections are hosted on their Lumen ohm server. Lumen offers a complete education managment system with grade books, a problem bank and communication capabilities. </p>

        <h3>OER implimentation</h3>
        <p class="lead">OER has been completely implimented in the following courses 
          <ul>
            <li>MAT095: Introduction to Algebra</li>             
            <li>MAT099: Fundamentals of Algebra</li>
            <li>MAT117: Algebra and Trigonometry</li>
            <li>MAT115: College Algebra and Trigonometry</li>
            <li>MAT120: Introduction to Statistics</li>
          </ul>
        Each course has an OER textbook and a master section that includes automatically graded homework problems, a grade book, and communication tools.
        The master sections for these courses are in their final versions. New syllabi have been approved by both the department and college curriculum commiteeies. In addition, in Spring I 2019, we are piloting a section of MAT121 using OER resourses.</p>
      </section> 
      <section>
        <h3>Number of OER sections and textbook/online platform savings</h3>
        <p class="lead">For Fall I and II of 2018 there were a total enrollment of more than 5,650 students in 207 OER sections. In Spring 2019 an OER MAT121 section was piloted. For Spring I and II 2019 there were 4,634 students in 159 OER sections. This has led to an estimated textbook savings of $846,907.25 for the 2018-2019 academic year.</p>

      <h3>Mentorship program</h3>




        <p class="lead">In order ensure the switch to OER goes smoothly we instituted a mentorship program. We have ten experienced faculty members who have dedicated hours to help faculty sort out any difficulties that might come up.</p>

        <h3>Copyright considerations</h3>




        <p class="lead">The OER copyright team in consultation with the library has developed a concise set of guidelines for proper attribution of OER/creative commons resources and implemented those guidelines in the master sections. The flow chart below describes the process faculty members should adopt for including outside materials in our courses.</p>
