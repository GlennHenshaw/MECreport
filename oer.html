        <p class="lead">
        <strong>Open educational resources (OER)</strong> are free and openly licensed educational materials that can be used for teaching, learning, research, and other purposes.
        <p class="lead">
        Developing OER was a major initiative for MEC during the 2018-2019 academic year. Below we list some of our accomplishments and statistics pertaining to our OER efforts.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>OER has been completely implimented in the following courses MAT095, MAT099, MAT117, MAT115, MAT119, MAT120.</h3>
        <p class="lead">The master sections for these courses are in their final versions. And new syllabi have been approved by both the department and college curriculum commiteeies. In addition, in Spring I 2019, we are piloting a section of MAT121 using OER resourses.</p>

        <h3>Student textbook and online platform savings </h3>
        <p class="lead">For Fall I and II of 2018 there were a total enrollment of more than 5,650 students in 207 OER sections. In Spring 2019 an OER MAT121 section was piloted. For Spring I and II 2019 there were 4,634 students in 159 OER sections. This has led to an estimated textbook savings of $846,907.25 for the 2018-2019 academic year.</p>
