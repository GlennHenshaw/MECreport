      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p class="lead">The Assessment Board of the Department of Mathematics, Engineering and Computer Science (MEC) is pleased to present the Annual Report for the 2018-2019 academic year. This report contains the latest information and data gathered and analyzed by the Assessment Board in collaboration with LaGuardia Community College’s Office for Institutional Research and Assessment. </p>
      
      <p class="lead">
      This report attempts to create a profile for the MEC Department by outlining its trends and statistics. In addition, this report serves as support to the Department’s Strategic Plan and Program Progress Report (PPR). It contains all the detailed characteristics and statistics of the MEC department, the success rates of the traditional courses, the details of the new courses being created in our department’s majors, and the new initiatives to support students learning, shorten their path to graduation, and create opportunities and their future. 
     </p>

      <p class="lead">
      We hope this report gives you a clearer image of our department; we welcome your suggestions on how future issues might help you assess your own work or other aspects of the department. 
      </p>
